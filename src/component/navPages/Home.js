          <h6>Why is it that we love Madras so much?!</h6>
          <div>
            It has always been truly significant to us compared to the rest on
            the Global map. Madras, one of the main reasons behind the new
            India. A place where people came together and flourished. Where
            everyone who has come in search of their dreams has made it big with
            perseverance and grit hand-in-hand with the charisma of the city.
            From cinema to the tech giants of today, you can see and experience
            ever evolving excellence here. Keeping all that aside there is so
            much more to the city - the culture, the people, the architecture
            and the overall flavour of it which is so underrated because of what
            people miss to notice. From the yellow autorickshaws which defy
            physics to the longest beach in Asia this city is there to stay in
            every visitorâ€™s mind.
